% Not sure where something goes awry, probably in the lowpass filter, but

% I'm dividing the final result by pi.

% Apply a RC lowpass filter with time constant tau = RC to data with sampling
% interval dt. NOTE tau and dt need to be in the same unit (i.e. s or ms)
% The SAFE model abstract by Hebrank et.al. just says "Lowpass with time-constant tau",
% so I decided to make the most simple filter possible here.
% The RC lowpass is also appealing because its something Siemens could have
% easily implemented on their hardware stimulation monitors, so I'm probably
% pretty close. - TW
